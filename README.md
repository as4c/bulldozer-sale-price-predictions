# Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Bulldozer Sale Price Predictions project! In this project, we aim to predict the sale prices of bulldozers using machine learning regression techniques. This README file provides an overview of the project structure, files, and datasets.

## Project Files
* 1. Bulldozers-sale-price-predictions.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code and analysis for the bulldozer sale price predictions. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

* 2. Data Dictionary.xlsx: This Excel file provides a detailed description of each feature (column) present in the dataset. It includes information such as feature name, data type, description, and units (if applicable).

* 3. Test.csv: This CSV file contains the test dataset, which you can use to evaluate your trained model's performance and make predictions on new data.

* 4. Train.zip: This ZIP archive contains the training dataset in CSV format. You'll use this data to train and validate your machine learning regression models.

* 5. TrainAndValid.zip: Another ZIP archive containing combined training and validation data in CSV format. You can use this for alternative data splitting and training.

* 6. Valid.csv: This CSV file includes the validation dataset, which can be used to evaluate the performance of your trained models during development.

* 7. dependencies.txt: This text file lists all the dependencies and packages required to run the Jupyter Notebook and associated code seamlessly. You can use it to set up your development environment.

* 8. test_predictions.csv: After training your model, you can use it to predict the sale prices for the test dataset. This CSV file will contain the predicted sale prices for the bulldozers in the test dataset.

### Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bulldozer-sale-predictions.git
```
Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```
Extract the training data from the Train.zip and TrainAndValid.zip archives and place the CSV files in a folder named data within the project directory.

Launch the Jupyter Notebook Bulldozers-sale-price-predictions.ipynb to explore the code, run the analysis, and train your machine learning regression models.

After training and fine-tuning your model, use it to predict sale prices for the test dataset (Test.csv). The predicted prices will be saved in the test_predictions.csv file.

### Usage and Contributions
Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code according to your requirements. If you find any issues or improvements, please create a pull request or raise an issue in the repository.

Happy predicting and have fun bulldozer sale price forecasting using machine learning regression!
